// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = 5
b = 6
c = a + b

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

IF(number % 2) == 0
	print("It's even number")
ELSE
	print("It's odd number")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
AVERAGE = SUM(Numbers)/5
PRINT(MAX(Numbers))
PRINT(MIN(Numbers))
The average is found my adding all numbers, then dividing by 5. The answer is 75.
The minimun number in the list is 10. The maximum number in the list is 50
